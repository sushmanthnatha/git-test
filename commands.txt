npm init
npm install lite-server --save-dev  # using this for the development purposes

go to package.json file created during the (npm init) and in the 
scripts add this: 
script:
{ "start": "npm run lite","lite":"lite-server" }
So start is a command that NPM supports which enables you to specify a bunch of things that will be started
"lite", which I will configure as "lite-server", 
# lite-server does auto sync of html files etc in the folder
